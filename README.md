# SearchEngine
Search Engine is a basic search engine which reads the contents of objects and put it on web page.
A user can search using keywords and delete from searched data.
User can also reset everything using Reset button.

Core java, jquery and ajax is used to develop this. There is no external library used
(However I am trying to implement elastic search in java as well. I shall update the code once it is done).
